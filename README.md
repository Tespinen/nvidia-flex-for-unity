# nvidia-flex-for-unity
The files will not work when imported into Unity, currently trying to fix the rep. Don't download yet.

An unofficial reposity for the NVIDIA Flex plugin/demo(s) for Unity.

NVIDIA Flex is a bunch of physics systems built for Unity by NVIDIA.

My own notes:
Seems to work with even non-NVIDIA based devices (Intel, AMD, and so on). I wouldn't suggest trying to build for mobile or older devices though, as Flex seems to be pretty heavy on performance. It also seems to work with even the newest versions (2021 LTS, 2022.1, etc), though I'm not sure if it works properly on HDRP or URP, as I personally could only get a stable FPS when running it on the built-in pipeline, as I'm using a lower-end PC. You might get a few compiler errors in newer versions of Unity, but you can fix them by just deleting the mentioned scripts in the errors and it should work still fine.

DISCLAIMER:
WORKS ONLY WITH UNITY - THIS IS THE UNITY VERSION OF NVIDIA FLEX

I am not saying that I own Flex, or the rights to it. I am here to merely distribute the package. Flex was removed from the Unity Asset Store a while back, and it was pretty hard to get your hands on it after that happened. I managed to find a download to it, and decided to share it with the world once again as I think that it's quite an interesting package.

[The license in this reposity was taken from the official NVIDIA reposity for the downloadable Flex demo]

You are not allowed to use *this* plugin of Flex commercially, but you should be allowed to try to find other ways of getting Flex working in Unity. 

THIS IS ONLY FOR RESEARCH AND TESTING PURPOSES.

Thanks, and have fun!
